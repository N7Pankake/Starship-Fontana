# Starship-Fontana
kind of a space invaders replica project for my Games Development class
what the game does:
-Aliens move to the right, then to the left and finally they move down just like the alien invader game
-Aliens do shoot
-Aliens do have a different bullet/projectile is not the same as player
-Aliens can destroy player bullets/projectile and the player can do the same
-Aliens bullet/projectile will destroy the barriers/walls after certain amount of hits
-Player bullets can go through the wall but aliens bullets can't go through (is meant to be like this).
-bullets of any kind alien/player will disapear as they collide with anything (aliens can't destroy coin)
-Coin behavior is ... abnormal and will run from the player must of the time so you don't destroy it (atm destroying the coin doesnt give any kind of award).
